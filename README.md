# Display digit classification - Neural Networks

Project for classifying digits from display to 10 classes (digits 0-9)

## Steps
1. train my own neural network from scratch
2. use pretrained model and train it to my dataset (transfer learning)

## 1. My own NN
dataset of 10 digits
1-9 - same labels, 0 - label 10

model 1 - 3 classes, OK
molel 1 - 10 classes, realy bad

model 2 - 10 classes - accuracy 99%, val_acc = 80 %, test - baad

## 2. transfer learning
- just for 3 classes 
- 10 classes - baad
